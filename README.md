# Call Centre Trends Visualising customer and agent behavior.
Creating a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for Claire that reflects various relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics can provide a clear overview of performance. Below, I'll outline the structure of the dashboard, including potential KPIs and metrics:
1. Overall customer satisfaction Overall calls answered/abandoned 
2. Calls by time Average 
3. Speed of answer Agent’s performance quadrant -> 
4. Average handle time (talk duration) vs. calls answered
The above dashboard provides Claire with a holistic view of call center performance, agent productivity, and customer satisfaction. It enables her to identify trends, areas for improvement, and top-performing agents. The interactivity and drill-down options empower her to explore data in detail, making informed decisions to optimize call center operations.

It empowers her to identify patterns, demographics that might be more prone to churn, and areas for improvement in customer retention strategies. The interactivity and drill-down options enable her to explore data in detail to make data-driven decisions.
